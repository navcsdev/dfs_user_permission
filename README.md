# User permission

Working well with java version

```txt
$ java -version                                                                                                           1 â†µ
java version "1.8.0_172"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_172-b11)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.172-b11, mixed mode)

$ javac -version
javac 1.8.0_172
```

### Output result

Output is stored in text file `output.txt`. Execute command below for
getting output file.

```bash
./gradlew run
```

the command should print

```text

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 0s
3 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 2 up-to-date
```

check output file

```bash
cat ./output.txt
```

output should look like

```text
A,B,C,D,E,F
A,B,C,D
A,B,C,E
A
D
A,C
A,B
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
1, 3, 4, 5
```

### Update input

Input files are stored in `./src/main/resources`. Data input can be updated by edit text file `input.txt`.

## Question 2

Test cases are placed in `src/test/java`

```bash
./gradlew test
```

output should look like this

```text
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
5 actionable tasks: 5 executed
```

## Question 3

### Time complexity O(U + P) with U is number users, S is a number permissions

```
1 while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
2    User current = stack.peek();
3    LinkedList<User> staffs = current.getStaffs();
4
5    if (!staffs.isEmpty() && !visited.contains(current.getId())) {
6        visited.add(current.getId());
7
8        Iterator<User> iterator = staffs.descendingIterator();
9        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
10            stack.push(iterator.next());
11        }
12    } else {
13        stack.pop();
14        handler.handle(current);
15    }
16 }
```

The lines 5-15 is constant. It executes U times. Thus total work done O(U).

The line 5-15: For each while loop they have been executed same number of times as the elements in staffs of user (max is number permissions of user) so the complexity is O(P).

Combining these two separate works done the total work comes out to be O(U) + O(P) = O(U+P)
